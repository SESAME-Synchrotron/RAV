# Image Collection Software

This software was developed to streamline the collection of image data frames from two cameras installed at the beamline. Key features include:
- Support for adding multiple cameras as needed.
- Dynamic definition and control of up to four Regions of Interest (ROIs) per camera.
- Built-in tools for data labeling and organizing collected samples.
- Application of a consistent naming convention to all saved data.
- Control over camera exposure time for each device.
- Ability to save both the full original image and each ROI in multiple formats (TIFF and JPEG).
- Convenient interface to list, view, and manage collected datasets.
