# Pickup Position Parser

**Objective**: To detect and validate the pickup position using the fingers as reference points.

- **Model Used**: YOLOv8s (Small variant of YOLOv8)
- **Training Environment**:
  1. **Device**: Office PC  
  2. **Training Duration**: ~6 hours  
  3. **Epochs**: 250  
  4. **Dataset Size**: 190 augmented, annotated images (generated using Roboflow) with the following parameters:  
     - Grayscale: Applied to 20% of images  
     - Brightness Adjustment: Between -24% and +24%  
     - Blur: Up to 1 pixel Gaussian blur  
     - Noise: Added to up to 1.72% of image pixels  
  5. **Confidence Threshold**: Predictions were considered valid if the confidence was â‰¥ 78%.
